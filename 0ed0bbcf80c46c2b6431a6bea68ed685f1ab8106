      "message": "Feels too clever. Do we need RAII here? Would a try {} finally work okay?\n\nIf unbuffer fails e.g. due to the client disconnecting, it seems okay for that to mask another exception that was thrown in the try block. In other words, I don\u0027t think we need the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Throwable.html#addSuppressed(java.lang.Throwable) magic.\n\nIs it guaranteed when unbuffer is called that we have finished reading rawIn? Should unbuffer tell rawIn to consume any remaining input? What happens if someone tries to read from pckIn afterward?",

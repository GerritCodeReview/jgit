      "message": "Isn\u0027t that too expensive? You are inspecting the whole repository for changed/added files although you know that you are interested in a single path. You just want to know whether /path/to/submodule is marked dirty when asking the parent repository. At least you should set a filter for the indexDiff to concentrate only on a certain path (e.g. indexdiff.setFilter(PathFilterGroup.createFromStrings(...));\n\nAlternatively you could even check manually whether the submodule repo is dirty. If the submodule repo is clean then check whether the submodules repo HEAD has the same ID as what we have stored in the index of the parent repo. If that is also true then the submodule is clean.",

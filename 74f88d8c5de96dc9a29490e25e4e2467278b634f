That kind of checkouts we do e.g. during clone to do the very first checkout.\n\nYou should also add a test for standard DirCacheCheckout which happens e.g. during a commit. I would simply do a second commit on refs/heads/master which tries to add malicious pathes. It\u0027s completely different code in DirCacheCheckout which is executed then and which is worth to be tested.",

What I meant was: Create a second commit object and then check it out. \nWhat you changed in line 518 of https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/4617/12/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/dircache/DirCacheCheckout.java is not covered by the tests. And that line is called much more often then line 309 for which you provided a test.\nIf you simply create another commit with bad content and check it out then we cover an important line in DirCacheCheckout (because then HEAD is !\u003d null and we do a non-trivial checkout).",

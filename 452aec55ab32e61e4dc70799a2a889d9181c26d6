      "message": "This method was just pushed down from RepositoryTestCase, because it was not really using any member variables from the child class, and was useful for writing tests. This should probably be broken into a separate commit and proposed as a distinct patch.",

I called it \u0027DirectoryFlags\u0027 for now, to try to model it off of the enumerated values in the C code... but since I\u0027ve only implemented a single one of those flags, I\u0027m not sure if that makes sense.",

      "message": "As mentioned in the comments on the bug tracker, this logic is not quite as sophisticated as what native git does here, and it might be preferable to extend it to match that logic more closely. However, I think that in order to do that, it might be necessary to have access to the current state of the index for the working tree from this spot in the code, and that seemed like it might be challenging to achieve.",

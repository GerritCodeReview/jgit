      "message": "If we hit this situation than we would go through this loop as fast as possible until the stale file handle situation is corrected. I don\u0027t know how long it takes typically until this stale-file-handle situation is resolved but if you expect that this may take seconds then we should add  a sleep() before we continue. Then we wouldn\u0027t burn CPU cycles with active waiting and would allow other threads/processes to do something meaningful.",

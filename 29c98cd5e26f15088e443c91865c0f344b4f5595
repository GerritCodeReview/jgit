      "message": "What this enum represents is the status of the index for a certain path regarding the stages. Which stages do exist for this path and which not. I would rename it to StageStatus, Stages or something like that. Do you have a better name?\n\nWhy? Because I have problems with a conflict type called \"BOTH_DELETED\". Both deleted should be fine! That\u0027s not the reason for/type of a conflict.\n\nThe same argument goes for ADDED_BY_US, ADDED_BY_THEM, .... . These all don\u0027t describe situations where we don\u0027t expect a conflict.\n\nBut besides this I like the idea to publish the stageState.",

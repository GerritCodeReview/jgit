      "message": "What this enum represents is the status of the index for a certain path regarding the stages. Which stages do exist for this path and which not. I would rename it to StageStatus, Stages or something like that. Do you have a better name?\n\nWhy? Because I have problems with a conflict type called \"BOTH_DELETED\". Both deleted should be fine! That\u0027s not the reason for/type of a conflict.\n\nThe same argument goes for ADDED_BY_US, ADDED_BY_THEM, .... . These all don\u0027t describe situations where we don\u0027t expect a conflict.\n\nBut besides this I like the idea to publish the stageState.",

      "message": "very good example in the stackoverflow discussion. A file x was renamed in one branch to y and in another branch to z. When merging the branches I get a conflict. Is this one conflict or is it three conflicts (one on x, one on y, one on z)? For me this is one conflict and I can find out the kind of the conflict by looking at the index state. Because I see there a BOTH_DELETED in combination with a ADDED_BY_US/ADDED_BY_THEM I learn what kind of conflict it is. But BOTH_DELETED is not sufficient for me to understand why I have a conflict.\n\nDon\u0027t get me wrong: I like BOTH_DELETED and all that names, but I wouldn\u0027t call it a conflict type.",

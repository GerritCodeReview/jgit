But I think as non-committer I cannot forge author identities on Gerrit and thus Gerrit would reject an update if I only changed the committer?\n\nJust tried pushing with Doug set as author and apparently it gets rejected even earlier by the foundation\u0027s validation hook:\n\n  Authored by: Doug Kelly \u003cdougk.ff7@gmail.com\u003e\n\n  The author is not a committer on the project.\n  error: The author does not have a current Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA) on file.\n\nSo what now? Assume I changed enough, or drop all this, find some other way to implement this, and then push a completely new change?",

But I suspect the validation hook will reject your push, too, if the author is set to Doug.\n\nI consider myself credited sufficiently by the signed-off-by line, so splitting this in two commits is IMO not necessary. Unless you\u0027d want to have a 100% correct blame history in the repository. OTOH, by resurrecting this old change I have kind of assumed responsibility for it, so having my name show up for this change isn\u0027t that wrong either.",

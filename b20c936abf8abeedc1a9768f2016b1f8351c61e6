The reason we say \"must not contain LF\" in the javadoc is because we don\u0027t do a replaceAll of \"\\n\" with \"\\nerror: \" to get the prefix we insert injected at the start of each line.  Maybe I\u0027ll come back and actually relax that Javadoc to say \"should not\" instead of \"must not\".",

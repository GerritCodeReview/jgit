What if you have staged content with crlf and the workingtree file contains exactly the same bytes you have staged. If you set autocrlf to INPUT wouldn\u0027t that mean that we have to report that the contents differ? What\u0027s in the file is different from what you read (eol-canonicalized) from the index.",

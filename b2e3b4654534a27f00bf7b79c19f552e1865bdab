      "message": "But it should not and it appears that IndexDiff wasn\u0027t even supposed to report it, but still does, at least sometimes which is a huge performance loss in EGit. We should do things like C Git here and just report the untracked directory. Using gitignore is too complicated and in the general case will not help.",

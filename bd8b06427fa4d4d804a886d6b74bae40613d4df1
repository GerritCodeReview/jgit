      "message": "Why is this objectDatabase not refactored as well? Granted, not everything has a file - is this function scheduled for later deprecation? If so, perhaps having a @deprecated would be a good idea. If not, can we call getObjectDatabase() and do some instanceof check?",

I didn\u0027t want to bother dealing with editing this here, to only remove it later.\n\nI\u0027m pretty sure that the way I did this series was non-optimal, and that yea, there\u0027s a case like this where something that should be changed in this commit, wasn\u0027t, because its gone 3 commits down or whatever.  *sigh*  That\u0027s what I get for doing some experimental refactoring hacking, and winding up with a 65 commit series.",

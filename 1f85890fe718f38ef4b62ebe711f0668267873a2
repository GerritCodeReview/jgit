Which might be correct, so I wonder if we shouldn\u0027t drop the \"ref !\u003d null\" test above just so the code isn\u0027t reading like we are risking an NPE here.\n\n(I\u0027m pretty sure that symbolic.get() won\u0027t return null, and that resolve() also won\u0027t return null, and thus that the ref !\u003d null test above is wrong.)",

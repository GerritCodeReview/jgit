      "message": "Bug in Eclipse.\n\nThe formatter insists on putting a space at the end of a blank Javadoc line.  The formatter runs after the remove trailing space on a blank line during save.\n\nYou can coax it into removing that space by deleting it manually, saving the file, then doing undo right away.  Yes, its crap.  But I don\u0027t have the time or the energy to debug this part of Eclipse and patch it.",

      "message": "Doesn\u0027t AndTreeFilter take a List also?  If so can\u0027t we make a temporary list here and put the three default items in, then the one conditional user filter?\n\nIf the user filter is a path filter (and it probably is) its faster if its first in the list.  Paths are very cheap to evaluate and they rule out most of the project\u0027s files.",

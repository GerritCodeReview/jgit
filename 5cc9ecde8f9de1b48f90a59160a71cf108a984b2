It would be better if such an optimization could also appear on your computer.\n\nI opened the repo once and repeated the method 10 times in a custom test case and averaged the results to get the numbers below.\n\nThe measurements were produced on my MacBook 2019(2.6 GHz 6-core Intel Core i7 and I have used it for three years), which may be different on different computers.",

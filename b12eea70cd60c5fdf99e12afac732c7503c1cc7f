      "message": "Long ago I worked with C compilers that were too stupid to remove the boolean test for \"while (1)\".  So unending loops were written as \"for (;;)\" to work around it.  The Java compiler is obviously not that stupid, and neither are any modern C compilers, but habit is habit.\n\nOur coding standard at this point is more-or-less \"loop with no conditional\" is spelled as \"for (;;)\" because most of them have been written by me.",

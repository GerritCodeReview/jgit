Regarding when to return the idBuffer you are of course right ... - I\u0027ll propose a fix for that now.\n\nRegarding the index update: When the index is updated is currently not in the scope of this change. We are never under the hood updating the index. Do you know when \u0027git status/diff\u0027 update the index? I could imagine that it definitely make sense to correct the smudged status of index entries when during a walk get real info about whether a file is dirty or not.",

      "message": "Ah, you are probably right. These could be changed to sets.\n\nThere aren\u0027t that many callers inside of JGit, but changing this type from Collection to Set will impact our public API and break it. Are we ready to go to JGit 2.0?",

      "message": "Christian is right, we can add a new method that accepts Set here, and keep the Collection version with this auto-convert-to-Set logic in it before invoking the new Set driven version, and mark that Collection version @Deprecated to be removed in 2.0.\n\nI\u0027ll try to rework the patch sometime today and get an updated version uploaded.",

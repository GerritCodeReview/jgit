      "message": "The overall plan is that Android moves to git submodules natively. Part of this plan is that Android must have a superproject.\n\nWe actually have something internally that does roughly this (manifest -\u003e submodules) already, but it uses a cron type mechanism that isn\u0027t supported in Gerrit. It also doesn\u0027t generate relative URLs correctly. Hence the fixes here.\n\nSimultaneously, Stefan is working on the git-core aspects there (as discussed at the summit). The rough idea is that we will use hooks in Git to replace some (readonly) submodules with symlinks into slothfs (https://github.com/google/slothfs).",

The plugin (2) is actually giving the finishing touch to Gerrit. \n\nThis change helps with (2) as well, I would assume.",

      "message": "I can likely test a few more of the options defined in the DiffTool class, let me know if that is necessary.\n\nI think the most meaningful command option to test would be \"--prompt\", but that requires interaction with the input stream of the command. I\u0027m not sure how to do that; I\u0027ve used TextBuiltinTest as a base for this test, I guess runAndCaptureUsingInitRaw() can be adjusted to also write something on the command input stream. Let me know if you think a test like this is required.",

I\u0027m guessing if we don\u0027t remove it, we will fill out the current test cases with more meaningful testing, as we progress through the suggested commits.",

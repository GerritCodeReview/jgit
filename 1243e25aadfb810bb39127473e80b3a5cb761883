      "message": "I wasn\u0027t able to figure out what this function does based on the name alone. Likewise based on the first paragraph of the javadoc.\n\nIs this meant as a D/F conflict-aware sort function? After a while of reading, it seems like aPath is meant to be fixed and bPath is meant to vary; what do aPath and bPath represent here? (e.g., is aPath a path used in path-limiting, while bPath is a tree entry to match against it?) Can you give some examples in the javadoc? E.g. does\n\n  dfAwareCompare(\"a\", \"a\", MODE_TREE) \u003d\u003d 0\n  dfAwareCompare(\"a.\", \"a\", MODE_TREE) \u003c 0\n  dfAwareCompare(\"a\", \"a.\", MODE_TREE) \u003e 0\n  dfAwareCompare(\"a\", \"a0\", MODE_TREE) \u003e 0\n\n? What happens when there are subdirectories --- e.g., is\n\n  dfAwareCompare(\"a\", \"a/b\", MODE_FILE) \u003c 0\n\nbecause a/ comes before a/b?",

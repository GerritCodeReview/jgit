See IndexDiff.hasFiles(File).\n\nOn a side note: seems to me that IndexDiff.hasFiles() might be more efficient since it doesn\u0027t need to fire up the whole Stream machinery.\n\nAnd a totally unrelated thought: why don\u0027t terminal Stream operations not close a Stream if it\u0027s a Closeable?",

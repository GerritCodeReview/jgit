      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is correct. The test server is going to use that repo later; see lines 110f.\n\nThis is going to be ugly and will need individual solutions for all tests. Check the callers of HttpTestCase.createRepository(), and then for instance: SmartClientSmartServerTest.testFetch_FewLocalCommits(): that last test closes remoteRepository during the test, so adding it in setUp to addRepoToClose() would then try to close it twice. Yuck.\n\nAlso, I fear we\u0027ll have to have one huge change with all occurrences of this problem fixed to get a successful Jenkins build. :-(",

      "message": "Do you think this needs to return the actual Format in case it\u0027s different from fmt? If I hold on to the fmt I passed in, because of the way the classes are written, it will behave identically, so I think that\u0027s ok. But it would still be a reference to the class, in case that matters.",

      "message": "It seems like we have undefined behavior in terms of which entry is used if multiple callers register the same format with different names; formatBySuffix just does a linear search till it finds a matching suffix.\n\nIn fact, other than a couple of hard-coded examples and constants, how is a caller supposed to know what name to register a given format with at all?\n\nThis comes up because I just noticed I\u0027m actually, unintentionally, registering uppercase format names.",

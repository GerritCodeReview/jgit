      "message": "Similar problem as with Git and Repository. As a user of TestRepository and a caller of TestRepository.git() it\u0027s not clear to me whether I have to close the repo or not. On platforms like linux, macos it don\u0027t care much. It\u0027s testcode and I let GC do the work for me. But on windows you can write tests and because of a missing close on Repository or Git the cleanup phase of the tests (where folder hierarchies in filesystem are deleted) fail. E.g. see my commit da595f09 where I had to fix this.\n\nI would at least document whether I have to close what I get back from git(). Or more convinient: add a close() method.",

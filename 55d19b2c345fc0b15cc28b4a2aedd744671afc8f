      "message": "Similar problem as with Git and Repository. As a user of TestRepository and a caller of TestRepository.git() it\u0027s not clear to me whether I have to close the repo or not. On platforms like linux, macos it don\u0027t care much. It\u0027s testcode and I let GC do the work for me. But on windows you can write tests and because of a missing close on Repository or Git the cleanup phase of the tests (where folder hierarchies in filesystem are deleted) fail. E.g. see my commit da595f09 where I had to fix this.\n\nI would at least document whether I have to close what I get back from git(). Or more convinient: add a close() method.",

      "message": "The difference between TestRepository and Git is the only way to create a TestRepository is with a Repository that you pass in. You create it, so you\u0027re responsible for closing it; there\u0027s no ambiguity there. (And moreover, this change has nothing to do with that part.)\n\nI suppose I can see the argument that the caller doesn\u0027t know whether they should close this Git instance. In practice it doesn\u0027t matter, but I could make this clearer I guess.",

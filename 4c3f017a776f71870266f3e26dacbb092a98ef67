The keep packfile may contain even substantial (or even *most of them*) existing objects, especially if the client is out of sync with the server.\n\nIf we exclude *all* objects in the keep packfile, we may end up excluding the repacking of a substantial part of the repository and therefore not even creating a useful bitmap for it.\n\nThe correct approach, discussed on a private chat with @Matthias as well, is to consider the keep packfiles as _temporary files_ that are not confirmed or committed to the repo and therefore needs to be ignored and kept as-is.",

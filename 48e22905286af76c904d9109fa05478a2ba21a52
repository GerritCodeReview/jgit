I think I can recognize this case by observing that A and B share a prefix, B has a longer prefix before the *, and B has no suffix (similar for A and C). This will also identify that B and C overlap.\n\nAs long as I\u0027m confident that this is every case, I will go ahead and rename the method destinationIntersects and add this logic.",

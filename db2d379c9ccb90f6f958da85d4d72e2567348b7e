      "message": "Gone :-) I had overlooked that this was a public operation. All uses within JGit are exclusively for the check-in case. But as it\u0027s public, it is of course possible that someone calls it on an iterator used in a TreeWalk with OperationType CHECKOUT_OP. (Though I wonder: if there\u0027s no such use case in JGit or EGit, who would have such a use case?)\n\nI\u0027ve restored this bit. getEolStreamType() is now not called anywhere inside JGit or EGit.",

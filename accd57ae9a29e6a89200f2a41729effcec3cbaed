      "message": "Maybe that\u0027s only my personal taste but I think that these kind of methods make the test code harder to read then before. The method name is already very long and it still doesn\u0027t explain everything you do (\"modifiying file a\" - took me some time to understand the test case because I overlooked this method touches a). I prefer to have longer test-methods using utility methods with smaller scope then this long utility methods. How about modify(path) (creating-or-modifiying a file), checkout(branch) (creating (if not already there) and switching to a branch), and commit() (adding everything before).",

      "message": "Okay, I understand your concern. From my point of view writing tests becomes easier if you have more powerful utility methods. When you only have to change a parameter to create a new test, it becomes possible to increase the total number of tests significantly. Also refactoring tests is easier, I think. But reviewing these tests then becomes harder, that is true. So I have inlined most of these helper methods again and tried to come up with a compromise.",

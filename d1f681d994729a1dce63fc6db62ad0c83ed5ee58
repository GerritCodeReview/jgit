      "message": "Fine for me. It seems to be used only in EGit; I see no callers in JGit.\n\nThe clock skew handling is a little bit unclear. It seems to be a performance optimization heuristic. Not sure it\u0027s needed, and if someone pushes a commit with an old timestamp and I then fetch that commit, suddenly this ref isn\u0027t reported anymore? Sound flaky (and wrong) to me. For the current uses of findBranchesReachableFrom() it\u0027s not a big problem, but generally I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s a good idea to cut RevWalks based on timestamp info.\n\nWe recently ran into a similar case in UploadPack.okToGiveUp(), where the HEAD commit had an old timestamp: The server would not ACK wants from a client, the client kept sending wants until it finally gave up and sent a \"done\", and only then got the fetch pack. Occurred in a test with only two commits, but if that happened on a real repo with a long history, I fear it would have sent the whole history instead of just a few new commits the client didn\u0027t have?

JGit seems to be inconsistent about whether to declare it, and it\u0027s not important to me, but best to stay consistent within a file.\n\nThe Java Language Specification states\n\n\u003e It is permitted, but strongly discouraged as a matter of style, to redundantly specify the public modifier for interface methods.\n\nso perhaps we should clean this up globally in a separate change.",

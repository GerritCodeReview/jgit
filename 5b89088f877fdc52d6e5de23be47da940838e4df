      "message": "If I used a single ignore at the top level with the lines:\n\n  bin\n  target\n\nthese would match in *every* subdirectory within the entire repository.  Thus a source package called \"bin\" or \"target\" would be omitted, which may lead a contributor to forget to git add something they have created.\n\nThe only safe way to force limit these to the top of each plugin directory is to use a leading \"/\" as I have done.  I could use an identical file in each plugin (as this patch does), or I could have used a single top-level file with every plugin:\n\n  /org.eclipse.jgit/bin\n  /org.eclipse.jgit/target\n  /org.eclipse.jgit.test/bin\n  /org.eclipse.jgit.test/target\n\nEither form is ugly, but using the identical file makes it easier to setup a new project as you just need to cp .gitignore.",

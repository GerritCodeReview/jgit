      "message": "I find it mostly a matter of taste. The \"new\" logic is that new head tend get allocated to the left at the expense of other commits. \n\nLooking at JGit\u0027s history the new layout tends to re-use columns more. In total it doesn\u0027t reduce the total width of all column, unfortunately.\n\nI really don\u0027t understand the algorithm enough to say how to improve, but I do know the previous behavior is wrong and the current isn\u0027t as far as I can find, but I\u0027d appreciate if other too.",

      "message": "Yes, this algorithm is too complicated in my eyes also. I also contributed to this mess and I am not very happy about the current state.\n\nI can imagine that we could go in long discussions about how to present graph\u0027s correct. As Robin said, that\u0027s a matter of taste. I would suggest to save this discussion time and to take what \"gitk\" or \"git log --graph\" show as our goal. If we really find a thing where we dislike heavily what gitk shows we could diverge --- but I don\u0027t see this in the moment.\n\nI\u0027ll try to find some time over the weekend to add comments about this algorithm. Also I know about certain really wrongly displayed graphs where the topology is displayed wrong which I\u0027ll put into tests. \n\nI\u0027ll also try to finally bring in my change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/4863 which brings a lot some more very complicated tests and an easier way to test complicated graphs.",

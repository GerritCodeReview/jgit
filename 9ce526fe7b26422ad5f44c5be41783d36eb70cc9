The \"new\" logic is that new head tend get allocated to the left at the expense of other commits. \n\nLooking at JGit\u0027s history the new layout tends to re-use columns more. In total it doesn\u0027t reduce the total width of all column, unfortunately.\n\nI really don\u0027t understand the algorithm enough to say how to improve, but I do know the previous behavior is wrong and the current isn\u0027t as far as I can find, but I\u0027d appreciate if other too.",

      "message": "maybe it\u0027s time to find out?\n\nMy suspicion is that the handling of submodule URLs of git-core is sneaking in here. As the submodule URLs are \"just like directories\", you need an extra ../ (compared to real relative URLs) to indicate a location of a submodule.\n\ngit-core also has a bug, that doesn\u0027t handle \u0027/\u0027 correctly if the last part of the URL is \u0027.\u0027 or even \u0027..\u0027.\n\nSo we also have the code there to relativize a URL, but with unexpected results:\n\n  dir/subdir    + ../anotherdir  -\u003e dir/anotherdir\n  dir/subbdir/a + ../anotherdir  -\u003e dir/subdir/anotherdir\n  dir/subdir/.  + ../anotherdir  -\u003e dir/subdir/anotherdir\n  dir/subdir/.. + ../anotherdir  -\u003e dir/subdir/anotherdir\n\nThis confusion seems straightforward to fix, but for reasons of git-core being git-core (\"What if someone treats it as a feature? We don\u0027t want to break them. But nobody would do that right? Well, it turns out the test suite of git-core uses this hack a lot.\") we never came around fixing it properly.\n\nOn the other hand the example above can be easily explained when having the implementation in mind: We count the number of \"../\" in front of \"anotherdir\" and slash as many \"/*\" from the right of dir/subdir.\n\nHow would this implementation handle it?\n(Seeing the testcase \"testRelative(\"a/p/..//b/\", \"a/\", \"../\");\" seems promising in two ways: (a) do the correct thing and (b) be slightly different than git-core",

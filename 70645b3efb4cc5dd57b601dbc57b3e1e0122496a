      "message": "While I think that this statement is correct, I also see that HttpAuthMethod.Negotiate creates a *new* GSSContext on each configureRequest(). I think that is broken.\n\nAnother thing that I haven\u0027t quite found the answer to is how SPNEGO is supposed to work with several subsequent requests. I can\u0027t believe that each request has to be authenticated individually and go again through the several exchanges. I would expect a once established GSSContext to remain valid (after all,it has a lifetime), and be able to re-use it for multiple subsequent requests until the lifetime ends. But I don\u0027t see our code doing that, and I have not found any clear documentation of that. What should the token be to send on the second request once the GET has been successfully authenticated with NEGOTIATE?",

      "message": "If I am understanding the code in the class correctly, the constructor loads the entire file in memory upfront? It also looks like this is using a binary search to find objectId positions? I think the file format was designed to make binary searching possible without loading the entire file in memory, and I would expect a binary search to be used with that approach. Since this class seems to be using a load-the-entire-file approach, a binary search is likely not the most efficient approach O(log(n)), using a ObjectIdMap probably makes more sense O(1)?",

      "message": "Not needed since already done in BlameResult.\n\nBut in general I wonder if this mailmap transformation shouldn\u0027t be applied at a far lower level. Basically whenever a RevWalk produces a commit. Then BlameGenerator, LogCommand, etc could use a walk with setUseMailmap(true). Only problem might be signed commits? (Author as mailmap-translated would be different from author in signature...) Perhaps a RevCommit/RevTag then would need to distinguish between \"author\" (possibly mailmap-translated) and \"original author\" (as stored), and the same for \"committer\".\n\nNot sure... but something that might be worth having a design discussion about?",

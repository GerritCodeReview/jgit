If you are changing the size such that initTable gets called with a non-power of 2, and you can\u0027t read this much code, well... :-\\\n\nAs it is this class has some strange restrictions, like callers of the class *MUST* ensure they use add() *ONLY* if contains() would return false for the object. Otherwise its unpredictable what happens when there are duplicate mappings for an ObjectId.",

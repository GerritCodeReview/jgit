      "message": "Have you seen this failing? Maybe a test would be nice. If e.g. while inspecting file mode you see in the workingtree a GITLINK and in the index you see a FILE then we would reach this block. In this case we do not have to do a contentCheck anymore, or? Can you imagine differences in the Metadata where you say a contentcheck is needed?",

      "message": "I saw in debugger in compareMetadata() that we had a case where entry.getLength() !\u003d (int) getEntryLength() \n\nIt was 100 in one case and 150 in other. I have no idea where it comes from, but adding the GITLINK condition above resulted in right status.\n\nI think the differences are coming if I modify submodule directory content, e.g. if I do\n\ngit clone -b master --recursive\n\nI don\u0027t see that submodules are \"modified\". Once I touch something in submodules, OR do not clone them together with the parent repo, I see that jgit reports this \"modified\" status while git doesn\u0027t.\n\nSo this can probably be something related to timestamps of the directory/subtree?",

      "message": "Unfortunately if target is not normalized path, new File(target) will normalize it, so that physical link will differ on file system from the original one.\nE.g. \"/tmp/\" target will be created as \"/tmp\" etc.\nThis is limitation of Java 7 implementation, native git does everything right.\nAs a result, working directory of the repository containing not normalized link targets will be *always* dirty after checkout.\n\nIt would be nice if we could report here some kind of warning if(!nioTarget.toString().equals(target)){\nSys.err.println(\"Failed to create expected link (target is not normalized). Link: \u0027\" + path + \"\u0027, original target: \u0027\" + target + \"\u0027, created target: \u0027\" + nioTarget + \"\u0027.\")\n}\n\nAdditionally it would be nice to have some extra javadoc for the method here and in FS class.",

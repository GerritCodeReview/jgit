      "message": "My fault, I overlooked this line. \n\nRegarding: \"RFC change of mine\". Really, I wrote this change completely on my own some days back. Only now I checked your open proposals and saw that you have a similar open change. I would hate if somebody hijacks my open proposals without telling me and therefore it\u0027s important for me to make clear that I haven\u0027t copied your work. The fact my change contains mistakes you wouldn\u0027t do gives some proof, or? \n\nHow to proceed? I have no problems if we just take your proposal and let this one overwrite my change. Or we revert mine before.",

I didn\u0027t realize it was actually a different change. I apologize for assuming this was based on my work. FWIW, my change was I1556b7e7ea21c31ff76bca930269e0cc7d55cd26\n\nI think its stupid to revert this. Lets just make a new commit that fixes some of the comments I made in the post-submit review.",

      "message": "Drop this test and handle it through the FileNotFoundException below. We are unlikely to be here unless the caller received our path from a readdir() result, which means we are very likely to have exists() return true, making exists() pointless.\n\nIf the user application feeds us a file path explicitly (e.g. getRef(\"refs/heads/master\")) we should try the open call first, its again somewhat likely the reference actually exists and we need to read it from disk. If it doesn\u0027t exist, the exception is a bit more expensive than the stat(), but I think its a smaller percentage of requests that are doing getRef() for non-existing names.",

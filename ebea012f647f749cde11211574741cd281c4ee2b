      "message": "I almost made this change myself... but thought better of it.\n\nA passphrase isn\u0027t exactly a password. Its different because the passphrase is probably connected to a key or certificate file, while the password is connected to an account by a username.\n\nStringType is a generic item to hold any data. The \"true\" argument we pass to its constructor is to tell the UI to use a masked display when handling the input field (e.g. no echo, or display dots instead of characters).\n\nI would only suggest doing this if you also add a new CredentialItem.Passphrase type that is similar to the Password type. But that will require checking all implementations to ensure they will work with this new Passphrase type in a reasonable way.",

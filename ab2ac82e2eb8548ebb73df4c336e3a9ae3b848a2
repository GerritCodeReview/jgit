Inside that method we aquire lock\u0027s on refs and don\u0027t unlock them before trying to delete the refs. Everybody who uses JGit to call the public method RefDirectory.pack() is affected.",

      "message": "Why do we need \"depth \u003e 0\". Do we really want to handle refs located directly underneath \"refs/\" differently from those which are one directly below? I can understand that we don\u0027t want to delete the \"refs/\" folder itself and that therefore we behave differently on level 0 than on levels\u003e0. But unlocking refs should be done the same on all levels, or?",

I think the previous code would have worked for the console input stream, where the user types a small amount of text and hits enter.\n\nBut for the ByteArrayInputStream I use during tests, creating a new BufferedReader for each input read means the underlying stream is fully read by the first BufferedReader. Each subsequent BufferedReader then has nothing to read.",

      "message": "Thanks Thomasz. That was a amazing bug: \n\n- Our unit tests covered every line here\n- we had succesfull unit tests which covered the functionality of deleting empty dir\u0027s (they worked because of the removedEmptyParents() call outside the loop)\n- the code went through multiple reviews\n\n... and still this bug managed to be undetected. Good job.",

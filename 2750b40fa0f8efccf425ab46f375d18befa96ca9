      "message": "This test is not working for me on Windows. That\u0027s exactly the problem which caused corrupted repo\u0027s during GC: on windows we can\u0027t rename file a to file b if b already exists. I always thought this will work on windows as long as you have correctly returned all the handles of a and b beforehand. The current rename only does a retry if on windows but this doesn\u0027t seem to be enough.\n\nShould we change FileUtils.rename() to delete the target file if the initial rename fails and then retry?",

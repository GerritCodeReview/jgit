      "message": "Do you know of places in JGit where we would make use http.proxy config constant? I was surprised to see that we are currently not supporting it. As a standard java programm we are expecting people to call the java program with \"-Dhttp.proxyHost\" and \"-Dhttp.proxyPort\". I think it would make sense to support this config parameter ... but currently we are not doing and therefore there is no need for this constant. Or are you planning to add the support (that would be great)?",

      "message": "(Thanks for the note about the incorrect javadoc, fixed that part)\n\nHmm, very good point. I must admit I wasn\u0027t really aware of the existence of that one. They use different `TreeWalk` methods under the hood for performing their work; `isPathMatch` (in the case of `PathFilter`) and `isPathPrefix` in the case of `PathPrefixFilter`.\n\nLooking at the `PathFilterLogicTest` now, it does indeed seem very similar, so I don\u0027t think this change will anything useful to the project. Sorry to have wasted your (and my!) time. :)",

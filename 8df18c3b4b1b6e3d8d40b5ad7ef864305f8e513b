However, the OS keeps the file from actually being removed because it knows there\u0027s an open file handle. When you\u0027re on NFS that open file handle doesn\u0027t protect the file from deletion.",

Unless you\u0027re actually catching the stale file handle exceptions, you\u0027re not fixing the problem. Unfortunately, it looks like a lot of places use the packs returned by this call.

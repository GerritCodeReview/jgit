      "message": "Maybe what we should do is export an OutputStream the caller can ask for:\n\n  OutputStream getSidebandOutputStream() {\n    if (msgOut \u003d\u003d null)\n      return NullOutputStream.INSTANCE;\n    return new FilterOutputStream(msgOut) {  \n      public void close() {}\n    };\n  }\n\nThis way they can also control flush behavior and force the underlying side band to flush. Right now I think the messages get stuck in the side band buffer and don\u0027t head out to the client until its either full, or \"later\" when ReceivePack forces a flush at the end.",

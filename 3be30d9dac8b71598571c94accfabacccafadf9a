      "message": "Hm, I suppose I see what\u0027s different. It\u0027s still the issue where a given user (anonymous or otherwise) might have access to some repos but not others, and you want to make sure you have access to all of them before continuing.\n\nWhat happens in the case where a user is authenticated and wants to subscribe to repos A and B, but only has access to A. Should the server tell the user *which* repos they have access to? In the general case, finding the largest set of repos to which the user has access seems like it would take O(2^n) requests...\n\n(Apologies if this is covered in the implementation I\u0027m about to read.)",

      "message": "This request requires an explicit argument (the subscriber, which contains the list of repositories). In the other cases, the repository is built into the URI so it doesn\u0027t need to be passed as an argument. I could make it an argument on Transport.openSubscribe(Subscriber)?\n\nThis function will still need to exist in some form on SubscribeConnection, because it speaks the pubsub protocol. Other implementations speak the abstract \"InfoRefs\" protocol so they can reuse authentication and HTTP protocol specific communication. doSubscribeAdvertisement doesn\u0027t do anything special for HTTP, and should probably be called by a few other protocols as well at the beginning of a connection.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think it is possible to give detailed error messages without breaking/introducing features to smart HTTP.\n\nSmart HTTP relies on a 401 auth error to configure the connection properly, and if auth fails the URI is returned which is enough to determine the repository being accessed. For pubsub, I would need another way to pass the repository that caused the problem. I could add a body to the 401 response with a detailed error message, but this would break on upload/receive-pack errors and spew HTML to the console for the servers that don\u0027t provide the new error message. \n\nI could put the message into the status field (HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized: android), but that doesn\u0027t carry over to other protocols.",

      "message": "We should distinguish between needs-authentication and needs-authorization. I\u0027m using \"authentication\" and \"authorization\" as defined here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication#Authentication_vs._authorization\n\n(Note that HTTP\u0027s 401 Unauthorized code actually means \"unauthenticated\" by this definition. 403 Forbidden actually means \"unauthorized.\" But we can cut the spec authors some slack, at least they didn\u0027t misspell it like they did for \"referrer\" :)\n\nWhen an anonymous user doesn\u0027t have access, the server needs to return a 401 so libcurl/git can try again with credentials.\n\nWhen an authenticated user doesn\u0027t have access (i.e. is unauthorized) to one or more repositories, we have some more leeway. The general thing we do over smart HTTP (cf. GitSmartHttpTools) is return a 200 with some text in the body. This could be user-readable text, like \"Sorry, you don\u0027t have access to \u003crepository X\u003e\", that the client just echoes. Or it could be something in pkt-line format that the client is expected to parse and convert into user-readable text, like \"access-denied X\". The nice thing about this approach is that it\u0027s not HTTP specific; once the client gets 200 back from the server, it will interpret the body just like it would for a non-HTTP transport.\n\nDoes that make sense?

      "message": "Hm, I suppose I see what\u0027s different. It\u0027s still the issue where a given user (anonymous or otherwise) might have access to some repos but not others, and you want to make sure you have access to all of them before continuing.\n\nWhat happens in the case where a user is authenticated and wants to subscribe to repos A and B, but only has access to A. Should the server tell the user *which* repos they have access to? In the general case, finding the largest set of repos to which the user has access seems like it would take O(2^n) requests...\n\n(Apologies if this is covered in the implementation I\u0027m about to read.)",

      "message": "When it comes to naming of methods in JGits API we try to follow the names native git\u0027s command line options [1]. This makes it easier for new users of JGits API to find the options they need. It does not make sense always but that\u0027s what I see most of the time. E.g. there is setNoCheckout matching --no-checkout, setMirror matching --mirror.\n\nThere is no --tag-option in native gits cli. But there is a --no-tags option. So I would suggest to have at least a setNoTags() method.\n\nA small test which checks the functionality and also that the resulting repo has the right config (with tagOpts set) would be nice. \n\n[1] https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone",

      "message": "Thank you for the feedback. Do you mean that there should be an additional setNoTags-method or that it should replace the proposed setTagOption-method.\nThe purpose of this change as stated in the bugzilla is to allow configuring the remote configuration from the very start (and only the setNoTags-part is not helpful for our use case) rather than cloning (via EGit), configuring and having to do another fetch.",

      "message": "I would add a setNoTags() method so that developers knowing native git command line options find that.\n\nApart from that you can decide whether you stay with setTagOption() or add an explicit setTags(). With setTags() and setNoTags() you can do what you want, right?\n\nBtw.: how would you do what you want if you would only have native git? Are we adding a feature not present in native git?",

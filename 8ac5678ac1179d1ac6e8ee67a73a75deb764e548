      "message": "When it comes to naming of methods in JGits API we try to follow the names native git\u0027s command line options [1]. This makes it easier for new users of JGits API to find the options they need. It does not make sense always but that\u0027s what I see most of the time. E.g. there is setNoCheckout matching --no-checkout, setMirror matching --mirror.\n\nThere is no --tag-option in native gits cli. But there is a --no-tags option. So I would suggest to have at least a setNoTags() method.\n\nA small test which checks the functionality and also that the resulting repo has the right config (with tagOpts set) would be nice. \n\n[1] https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone",

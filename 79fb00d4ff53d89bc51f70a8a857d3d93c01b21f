Here you use SAP AG with no email, but in your new CPUTimeStopWatch class you use a different copyright line that I guess is the same (you at a sap email address).\n\nI\u0027m not against two copyright lines for you if one is \"stuff at work owned by SAP\" and the other is \"stuff on free time that SAP doesn\u0027t own\", but if they are the same (\"stuff at work that SAP owns\") it\u0027d be nice if they were consistent.",

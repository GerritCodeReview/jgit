      "message": "FileCommitGraph looks way clearer now! thanks a lot.\n\nI am confused with the removal of the ObjectDatabase#getCommitGraph() method. Is it because each reader knows its specific database, so then it is not needed in the interface?\n\nI guess it make sense, I don\u0027t have strong arguments for adding it. So far there is no use for it (so it would be public API for internal calls) and the fact that commit graph belongs to the object database is more a principle than something to enforce in the code.\n\nFew small comments, and this looks ready to me.

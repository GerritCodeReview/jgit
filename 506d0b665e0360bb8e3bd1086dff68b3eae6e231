      "message": "This change is going to force the JGit project to bump its version to 2.0 in the next release, because its a public API signature change.\n\nI can\u0027t think of a way to avoid this without making too much pain for the project. Making the current ReceiveCommits an abstract base class with no wire protocol information is also a breaking change.\n\nI may prefer to just accept this change and break the API and force us to 2.0 in the next release. Its not that much work for a consumer application to adjust their linking to this one change. In aggregate though it might get to be a lot. :-\\",

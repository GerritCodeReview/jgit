Unfortunately the Git experts have declared this is OK because the naming format for a file is flawed. *sigh*\n\nWhat you have is slightly better than before, but its still worrying.\n\nI don\u0027t have a good solution here. I have suggested Git rename these files to be based on a different SHA-1 computation, but that isn\u0027t going to happen anytime soon. I have also suggested all of these streams should be folded into a single stream, but that also won\u0027t happen anytime soon.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think so - the others seem to be things like MissingObjectException or ServiceMayNotContinueException. There is a slight amount of precedence in that PackProtocolException is also used for \"want\" with invalid hashes not necessarily caused by protocol error (normally \"want\" must only be used with server-reported hashes, and violation of this is a violation of protocol, but it is also thrown when allowreachablesha1inwant is active - removing the condition that \"want\" must be with server-reported hashes), although it could be argued that that was more for consistency.",

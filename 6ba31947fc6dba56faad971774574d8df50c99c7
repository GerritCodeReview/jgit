      "message": "I had trouble understanding the \u0027reject\u0027 test. It has structure\n\n  boolean reject \u003d A \u0026\u0026 B \u0026\u0026 C \u0026\u0026 (oversized \u003d D)\n\nIf reject is true, that means that A, B, and C were true, which means oversized got set to D and that it was also true. So why are these separate variables?\n\nI think the intent is\n\n if (blobMaxBytes \u003e\u003d 0 \u0026\u0026 object.getType() \u003d\u003d OBJ_BLOB \u0026\u0026 !walk.isGitFile() \u0026\u0026 ... size \u003e blobMaxBytes ...) {\n     // It could appear as a .git* file later in the traversal.\n     // Mark it as unseen to allow it to be considered again.\n     object.remove(SEEN);\n } else {\n     addObject(...);\n }\n\nIn other words, there\u0027s no such thing as rejected because of size --- all rejected blobs are rejected because of size.",

      "message": "I am not sure whether this is a problem. But by exposing the raw byte array to the outside world you cannot prevent that the path can be modified externally.\n\nE.g.\n\n  DirCacheEntry e\u003d.....\n  e.getRawPath()[0]\u003d\u0027a\u0027\n\ncould really break a lot of stuff. Before we had only getter methods return immutable objects like String.\n\nEither we all accept this risk. Or we use different solutions like returning in getRawPath() a copy the array. But that\u0027s not as performant as this solution",

      "message": "I wouldn\u0027t rename this variable as part of this change.  You don\u0027t reference it any new code.  So as bad as the name might be, I don\u0027t see a compelling motivation to change these lines as part of this commit.\n\nWe really try to avoid editing lines we don\u0027t have to.  If you were actually using t as a parameter to isSkipCurrentEntry() then I might be willing to accept a rename of it as part of the same commit.  But since you don\u0027t need it, it doesn\u0027t make sense.",

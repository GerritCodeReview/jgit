 * with exactly matching paths are merged, resulting in merge conflicts.
 * <p>
 * This walk provides the {@link org.eclipse.jgit.merge.ResolveMerger} a way to
 * process the renames in two phased
 * <ul>
 * <li>Non-renames: Processes all regular diffs, skipping any diffs related to
 * the rename.
 * <li>Renames:Processes each {@link RenameEntry} separately, pairing the
 * matching "source" and "target" path from the corresponding merge trees.</li>

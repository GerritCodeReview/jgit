The user must be allowed to do other things in order to discover what to actually do, e.g. look at history, code etc, etc, i.e. the same situation as we have when resolving conflicts. It would be ok to bring up the amend dialog by default, but the user must not be forced to amend before doing anyting else.",

It may  be as simple as the need to copy a small text from somehere else in the IDE. Can a cancel change the action into an edit? This often happens to me quite often, but I\u0027ve newer used the reword command.",

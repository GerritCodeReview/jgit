      "message": "1. I don\u0027t know how to detect these platforms.\n2. The code here is correct in general on all platforms. I don\u0027t see a problem with using it on all platforms.\n3. The other critical place would be LockFile.waitForStatChange(). That uses Files.setLastModifiedTime(Instant.now()), which _may_ have sub-milli resolution, but probably doesn\u0027t on these platforms.\n4. FileUtils.setLastModifiedTime() is specified to modify the time of the link if the path is a symlink. I don\u0027t know for sure, but I suspect File.setLastModified() might change the timestamp of the link target?",

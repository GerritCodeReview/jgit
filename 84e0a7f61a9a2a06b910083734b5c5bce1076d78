      "message": "no, I don\u0027t remember, it\u0027s been a long time since I last used cygwin (and Windows as well)\n\nSetting the FS explicitly for a new Repository was introduced in\nhttps://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/588\nit looks like the intention was to allow an application using jgit to explicitly specify if it\u0027s using cygwin or plain Windows. The path translation necessary for cygwin comes with a performance penalty. I doubt if this is done consistently across jgit\u0027s source code.\n\nNot sure how many jgit users use cygwin.",

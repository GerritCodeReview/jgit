      "message": "Just about the naming:\nThat name confused me. The name let me think there are two independent buffers of arbitrary length and you want to check whether they have the same prefix on the first x bytes. Then I would have expected a parameter prefixLen (which is not tied to buffer a) and that you check both buffers whether they at least have that length.\nFrom the implementation I would have expected a name like \"startsWith\" where you specifiy two buffers (the first one with length) and you want to know whether the second starts with the first.",

      "message": "Since this is API we have to be more precise:\n\nI would skip mentioning the \u0027mode\u0027 here. We are explicitly just returning content and no filemodes. \n\nWe are not returning content from the index as said in the javadoc but from a blob returned by the given ObjectLoader. So any version stored in the repo can be returned here. Index, HEAD, .... . Hopefully objectloader and path somehow match ... but we can\u0027t check that here.\n\nI would mention one important aspect of the method: It returns filtered content for an object. We don\u0027t return the raw blob data but do EOL handling and smudge filter handling before returning it to the caller.\n\nMaybe: \"Return filtered content for a specific object. EOL handling and smudge-filter handling are applied in the same way as it would be done during a checkout\"",

      "message": "This looks too similar to checkoutMetadata. In fact WorkingTreeOptions don\u0027t deal with etc filters. They deal with a limited set of config options: core.filemode, core.autocrlf, core.eol, core.checkstat, core.symlinks, core.hidedotfiles, core.dirnotgitlinks . Whereas checkoutMetadata deals only with smudge filters and eol handling attributes which we collect from .gitattributes files while traversing the workingtree. I know: horribly complicated.",

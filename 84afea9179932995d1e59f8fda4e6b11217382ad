      "message": "There appears to be a bug here, but I don\u0027t think it can arise in practice.\n\nWith low \u003e\u003d first and --low in the loop we could decrement low to be earlier than first and attempt to load index[-1] or set q to null. However this cannot happen because we already tested in the if block above that index[first] \u003e when. Thus we are never equal when low\u003d\u003dfirst and we won\u0027t hit this bug.",

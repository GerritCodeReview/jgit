      "message": "The old logic was: if the paths are equal by the pathname then both must be TREEs or both must be non TREEs in order to let compare return 0. You have changed that. If one of them is a GITLINK and you\u0027ll always return 0. Even if one is a GITLINK and the other one is a regular file. Sounds strange, or? Shouldn\u0027t compare on a file and a submodule return false?\n\nWhat about the idea to let this line in and modify lastPathChar() to return \u0027/\u0027 on TREEs and GITLINKs?",

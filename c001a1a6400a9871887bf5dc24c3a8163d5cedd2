      "message": "\u003e friend ping! hi Kyle, are you interested in working on Bloom Filters? If you won\u0027t be available to move forward the existing Bloom Filter reviews, do you mind I take over the code? \n\nSure, I\u0027m glad if you can take over this job. Actually, I don\u0027t have enough time to continue this work, due to my busy work recently.\n\nThe base code of commitGraph has actually been modified a lot, and perhaps you need to do a lot of work to rebase it.\n\nBy the way, I suggest referring to the code of this change and rewriting it based on the latest master branch instead of rebasing it (because there may be many code conflicts). \n\nAnd I don\u0027t mind if you change the author to your own name, just carry my \"Signed off by:\" in the commitMessage. I know there will be a lot of follow-up work.\n\nLooking forward to your code, and I am willing to review it. Thanks a lot.",

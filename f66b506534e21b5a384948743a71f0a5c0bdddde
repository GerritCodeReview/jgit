      "message": "Good catch - in fact, it is correct to skip the visit to the parents because we need to stop traversal at such objects. (If such an object were found as a parent, we would stop traversal there by not adding it to pending, so we should do the same here.)\n\nThere is a similar issue in the last patch in this patch set, and I have fixed that too.",

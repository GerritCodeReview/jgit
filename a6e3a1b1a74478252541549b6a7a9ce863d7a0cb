      "message": "Please add some documentation about how this is intended to be used.\n\nIs it a demo? Is it a way to get clients in the habit of signing pushes before a site operator is ready to turn on verification? Or is the idea that another PreReceiveHook verifies the signature, after this one checks that the signature is present? What is the advantage of having two hooks instead of the one that verifies the signature being responsible for checking that it is present?",

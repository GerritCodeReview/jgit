Fixes in old versions are merged up from wherever they were done: stable 5.x, stable-5.(x+1) until the highest released branch (stable-5.7 right now), then to master.\n\nFor the upcoming release, Matthias creates a new stable-5.y (y \u003d 8 currently) branch, usually around M2 of the upcoming Eclipse release. Until release, both stable-5.8 and master build a JGit 5.8.0. Development continues on master. Merging of fixes in old version remains unchanged (i.e., merge up to stable-5.7, then to master.) For M3, RC1, and RC2, master gets merged to stable-5.8, and the release candidates get built from stable-5.8. Until release, stable-5.8 is updated only from master.\n\nOn release, master is merged a last time to stable 5.8, and is then switched to build JGit 5.9.0. The release is built from stable-5.8: stable-5.8 becomes a released branch, and a new cycle starts. From that point on, fixes on old branches get merged up into stable-5.8, then master, and master is never merged into stable-5.8 anymore. For the next release, there will be a new stable-5.9 at some point.\n\nAt any time master may be merged into \"next\", which is the preparatory branch for the next major release (6.0.0). \"next\" is only updated from \"master\".",

      "message": "I like this API overall, but I believe we should have a separate method which will map sha1 -\u003e graph position. It is needed as your other methods accept graph position which is not declared anywhere. Also I can imagine cases when we already have a commit parsed from some source and we want to only read data which is not CommitData (e.g. check if there is a generation numbers v2 for a commit; check if commit is in commit graph, etc).\n\nAfter we will have this method we can potentially remove this one and do a low level chain (or create a default implementation there)",

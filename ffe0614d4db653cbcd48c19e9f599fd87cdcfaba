      "message": "The only reason we produce FETCH_HEAD is to be compatible with C Git.  The only reason C Git produces FETCH_HEAD is to carry data from `git fetch` into `git merge` during a `git pull`, but it does also act as a handy reference for \"the last thing I got\".  Really the only value for JGit to be writing that file is for the last part, \"the last thing I got\".  We\u0027ll never need to carry data from our fetch to our merge code through a local file, that\u0027s nuts.\n\nI think its perfectly OK if we stop writing this file on less-conventional repositories.  If \"the last thing I got\" proves to be really useful there, we could try to update a standard ref called FETCH_HEAD via updateRef().  But again, a lot of this all predates the idea of remote tracking branches being updated during fetch.",

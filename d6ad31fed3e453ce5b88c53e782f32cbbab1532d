      "message": "I find this class name confusing. We already have PackFile and File with their methods getPackName() and getName() and my first association was PackFileName is an abstraction of a PackFile\u0027s name which sounds like it could be the result of File.getName() or PackFile.getPackName(). This class extends File so the perfect name would be PackFile but that\u0027s already taken by the existing PackFile class.\n\nHow about naming it PackPath or PackFilePath to disambiguate ?",

      "message": "Yes, I think renaming PackFile (maybe to \u0027Pack\u0027) and making this class PackFile would solve this best. Martin and I talked about that challenge quite a bit. PackFileName seemed like a good compromise name.\n\nI\u0027m open to finding a less confusing name if we can. Wouldn\u0027t it be more confusing to have a class with Path in the name that isn\u0027t related to java Path? Would \u0027PackNameFile\u0027 make any sense? \u0027RealPackFile\u0027? ðŸ˜‚ PackRelatedFile? PackTypeFile?",

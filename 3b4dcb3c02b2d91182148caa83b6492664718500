If we are and i.getDirCacheEntry() \u003d\u003d null, we would execute the else case below and call keep(null), which should also then NPE, or NPE very late downstream when the new index contains an empty slot.\n\nI think the better question is, why are we looking at a subtree here in \"i\" and in this code path?",

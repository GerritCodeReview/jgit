      "message": "Is Ref the right type here? Shouldn\u0027t we introduce a type which can hold lightweight and annotated tags. Like Shawn suggested in http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#patch,unified,4346,1,org.eclipse.jgit.test/tst/org/eclipse/jgit/api/TagCommandTest.java\nIf we don\u0027t introduce it then the user of this API has to care for the details (checking that the ref is under \u0027refs/tags\u0027, differentiate between the different types of tags). Since this belongs to the public API we should get it right in the first shot.",

      "message": "Annotated tags have special attributes (taggerIdents, message) which I may want to process. How would you write code which list\u0027s all annotated tags which are tagged by a person X? The TagCommand.call() method would instantiate all the RevTag objects I need to get to this data, but you throw that info away and give me refs instead. As a caller I have to use RevWalks now to distinguish which of the refs you gave me are annotated tags and then to recreate these RevTag objects, or?",

      "message": "The GitAPI was meant as a high-level API. It is for developers willing to sacrifice performance in order to get an API which offers exactly the same methods as native-git commandline commands. Who don\u0027t want this penalty should use our tradiditional API (Repository, ..:Walk, DirCacheCheckout,....).\n\nFor such an API I find it ok that if I explicitly create a tag that I get back something tag specific. There are quite some use-cases where I have handle tags differently from other refs. Tags can point to other tags or even to other object types while e.g. branches always point to commits. If I want to know the commit a tag is pointing too (I very common use case I guess) I do that in a tag specific way. Reasons enough for me to introduce a type representing all our tags in our high-level API. Especially when I look at ListTagCommand.",

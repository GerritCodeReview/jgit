      "message": "Nothing wrong with hashing unequal instances to the same value. It\u0027s just equal instances must hash to the same value, which they do.\n\nAssuming this comes from a correctly-functioning client, the signature is literally already a hash of the rest of the contents you just mentioned (except nonceStatus), so it didn\u0027t seem worth it to hash everything else.\n\nI suppose there is theoretically a hash collision DoS attack where an attacker spams a server with the same invalid signature and different contents, knowing that they\u0027ll all be stored in the same HashMap. But that seems a little farfetched.",

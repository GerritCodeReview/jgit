      "message": "We could. I thought it was highly unlikely to even get here with FS_POSIX, and if we do, trying again happens once and shouldn\u0027t hurt. (Even on Windows getting here is not exactly likely; the forum post at [1] was the first I\u0027ve ever seen that indicates a problem with the environment variables.) It\u0027s also a bit more future-proof (what if FS_POSIX is ever changed to also consider $HOME?).\n\nuserHome() probably also should be final, but that\u0027s an API break.\n\n[1] https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1103963/",

      "message": "So the defaultValue must also be in the range. Is that intended? I would have thought that\n\n  int val \u003d getIntInRange(config, \"section\", null, \"value\", 3, 10, -1);\n\nwould have been useful: I can do\n\n  if (val \u003c 0) {\n    // Not set at all, do whatever is appropriate\n  } else {\n    // Was set, and val is in range.\n  }\n\nIf the default value needs to be in range, I can\u0027t make this distinction.\n\nIn the core.abbrev case, we make the distinction earlier when we get the value as a string, but there may be other cases. If we add a general getIntInRange, it should support this use case.",

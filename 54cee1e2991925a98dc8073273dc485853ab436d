But have you thought about the case where\n\n- base\u0026ours contain nothing for path p/x\n- worktree contains folder p/x\n- theirs contains a file p/x\n\nAfter/during a succesful merge we want to update the working tree with the file p/x from theirs. This will fail if in the same location a folder p/x exists, or? Maybe we need a test for this.",

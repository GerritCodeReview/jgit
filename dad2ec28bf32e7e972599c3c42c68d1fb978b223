Perhaps incrementOpen() should throw an exception if its useCnt.incrementAndGet() \u003d\u003d 1.\n\nOr we could do the increment before submitting the task; line 290 below:\n\n  repo.incrementOpen();\n  try {\n    executor().submit(gcTask);\n  } catch (RuntimeException e) {\n    repo.close(); // Couldn\u0027t submit the task\n    throw e;\n  }\n\nbut that leaves the question of what to do when the task is submitted, but then never runs. (If that can happen at all.)",

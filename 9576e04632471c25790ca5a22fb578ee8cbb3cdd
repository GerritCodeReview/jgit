      "message": "It would be great if some of these larger functions were further broken up to paint a better high level picture. For example, perhaps this would look something vaguely like:\n\n createChunks();\n writeHeader();\n writeChunkLookup()\n writeChunks();\n writeDigest();\n\nAs this might lead to quite a few more functions, perhaps a few extra classes are merited also, should some of the generation number stuff live in a separate file?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think it is likely to prevent that either. :(  The current implementation only limits this from happening per instance of the jgit FileRepository.  I suspect that many servers use one instance of FileRepository per request (even for requests to the same repo on disk), so other requests will likely not be blocked by this.  And, of course, requests in other servers will also not be blocked.",

      "message": "To the extent that that was possible before, it\u0027s still possible now, yes.  I guess the difference is that previously, a client would probably have blocked while the server was GCing, while now it might make a second request, causing a second auto GC.  This won\u0027t hurt correctness (unless it would have done so prior to this patch), but it will cause additional server load.\n\nOn reflection, I think regular git takes a lock before a background auto gc (\"gc.log.lock\"). I guess I\u0027ll change the code to do that.",

      "message": "How you pick the parent is ok for me. I am only complaining because in error cases you don\u0027t differentiate anymore between that I have picked a non-existing parent and that I have not picked a parent at all but specified a merge commit.\n\nAlso native git gives me different error messages in these situations. Try this:\n\n git init\n touch a\n git add a\n git commit -m addA\n git branch target\n git checkout -b side\n touch b\n git add b\n git commit -m addB\n git checkout master\n echo a \u003e a\n git commit -a -m modifyA\n git merge side\n git checkout target\n git cherry-pick master\n # the previous command returned: fatal: Commit 9ee535192272b65a6911fd19403176be7ba5c759 is a merge but no -m option was given.\n git cherry-pick -m 3 master\n # the previous command returned: fatal: Commit 9ee535192272b65a6911fd19403176be7ba5c759 does not have parent 3\n\nThe two last cherry-picks gave to different error messages and I would like to have two different exceptions (NoSuchParentException, MultipleParentsNotAllowedException) which express that.",

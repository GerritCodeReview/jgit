      "message": "I spent some time understanding why we have to change a method which doesn\u0027t depend on our newly introduced DIR_NO_GITLINK? We are changing semantics also in situations where DIR_NO_GITLINKS is not set. Of course I want to prevent that we break previously working scenarios. \n\nI spent long understanding the effects of your change, gave up and wrote down a table which shows the different results in old and new code:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gKq1xNyuN-vNZKJukEs7paX2NHbe2Fx4oavntwoWNso/edit?usp\u003dsharing\n\nIn three situations new code differs:\n\nIn these case new code returns GITLINK while oldCode returned TREE:\nisFileMode()\u003d\u003dtrue \u0026\u0026 iMode\u003d\u003dGITLINK \u0026\u0026 wtMode\u003d\u003dTREE\nisFileMode()\u003d\u003dfalse \u0026\u0026 iMode\u003d\u003dGITLINK \u0026\u0026 wtMode\u003d\u003dTREE\n\nIn this case new code returns TREE while oldCode returned GITLINK:\nisFileMode()\u003d\u003dfalse \u0026\u0026 iMode\u003d\u003dTREE \u0026\u0026 wtMode\u003d\u003dGITLINK\n\nSeems that in your code index mode has precedence over working-tree mode. Will we be able with your code to e.g. change from a GITLINK in the index to a Tree in the index (even if DIR_NO_GITLINK\u003dfalse)? What is if I had a gitlink in the index, change from submodule to normal files in the working tree and then add that tree?",

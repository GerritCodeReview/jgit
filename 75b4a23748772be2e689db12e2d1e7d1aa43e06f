      "message": "The old checkout code deleted a directory if it overlapped with a file. That no longer happens.\n\nI assume that if we are merging from \"src/foo\" existing to \"src\" as a file, \"src/foo\" and \"src\" are listed in toBeDeleted and \"src\" is in toBeCheckedOut.\n\nBy running toBeDeleted first we remove \"src/foo\" and then \"src\" successfully, and now toBeCheckedOut doesn\u0027t have to rmdir \"src\" in order to create \"src\" as a file.\n\nThis is the better way to handle the directory-to-file switch. If things go wrong, the switch will fail and the merge will abort.",

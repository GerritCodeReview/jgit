      "message": "Yes, many of these tests should produce identical results under MyersDiff.  We should take your Diff abstraction idea and abstract both implementations, then do a common base test suite that provides most of these tests and use two subclasses to drive them for each implementation.\n\nBut a few of these, especially testEdit_NoUniqueMiddleSideA and B variants are specific to the current implementation of PatienceDiff not having a fallback.  MyersDiff shouldn\u0027t have the same results here.  And neither would a PatienceDiff that had an actual fallback for the degenerate case these represent.",

      "message": "Super small diff algorithm. I like it.\n\nBut a more general question: I guess that in the end we want to configure which diff algorithm to use. It would be nice to have a silver bullet fitting all situations ... but that\u0027s not so likely, or? Even a patience diff sometimes wants to fall back to other diffs.\n\nSo, isn\u0027t it time for a DiffAlgorithm abstraction? Some common superclass of PatienceDiff and MyersDiff? And e.g. PatienceDiff would get an DiffAlgorithm as constructor parameter so it knows to which algorithm to fall back to?",

When we recurse on the left and right halves, both halves are required to each produce at least one Edit result.\n\nRather than doing:\n\n  EditList r \u003d new EditList();\n  r.addAll(diff(... before half ...));\n  r.addAll(diff(... after half ...));\n  return r;\n\nAnd having this nasty continuous recopying of data from one result list to another as we pop back up the call stack, we insert the edits in-place into the diff instance.

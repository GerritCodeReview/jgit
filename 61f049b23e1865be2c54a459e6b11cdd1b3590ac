The push command man page e.g. shows  that \"names of remotes\" and URLs are different things and both can go into this parameter. I guess that\u0027s why they didn\u0027t called it \"remote\".\n\nBut even if I could convince you: since the FetchCommand API is included in our released jgit version I can\u0027t change it anymore. And I agree: beeing consistent between Fetch and Pull is important.\n\nMaybe we could add additional setters for \"repository\" to all these commands just to be in sync with native git terminology.",

It produces a very small bitmap.\n\nWould something like this work?\n\n  /** @return null when the walk has finished */\n  @Nullable\n  private static RevCommit next(RevWalk rw, boolean ignoreMissing) throws IOException {\n    while (true) {\n      try {\n        return rw.next();\n      } catch (MissingObjectException e) {\n        if (!ignoreMissing) {\n          throw e;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\nLikewise for nextObject.\n\nThat said, I haven\u0027t checked if RevWalk is prepared to continue after noticing a missing object like this. RevWalk might need some changes to more gracefully recover (or it might make sense for the ignoreMissing logic to move there).",

What should jgit do if he see\u0027s options which he doesn\u0027t understand. If we say JGit should simply ignore options he doesn\u0027t understand than this change is ok. If we say JGit should deny working on PackBitMapIndexes with unknown options then this change is harmful. I can\u0027t decide.",

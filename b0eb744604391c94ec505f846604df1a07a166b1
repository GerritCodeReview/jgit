      "message": "Just for info:\nIt took me a little bit to find out why this works. I tried to write a test which checks that a \".content\" file has really the attributes defined by a \".gitattributes\". I thought that since .gitattributes is not parsed when .content is processed this could fail (you mentioned this problem in the commit message). But I learned that \u0027raw\u0027 is a buffer to a complete Tree data structure (and not only up to the point we parsed so far). Therefore this temporary \"itr\" TreeParser can \"overtake\" the original TreeParser and look ahead.",

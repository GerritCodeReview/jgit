      "message": "Uff, right - that\u0027s a severe bug. That\u0027s frustrating: although 3 people reviewed it, although I spent much time on writing a big test for this (much more time than for the fix of course) and although this was tested in advance by real-world-non-jgit developers using egit to merge .... although all of this happened a very basic use case doesn\u0027t work: merging two unchanged subtrees.\n\nWhen trying to fix this I wanted to write test which captures this bug. I found out that this is hard to reproduce with repos which have a real index. When merging with egit most people start with a c clean index and working tree: For each entry in ours we have an entry in the index and therefore we don\u0027t fall into this code block which is guarded with a \"if (index \u003d\u003d null)\". In Gerrit we are always working with an in-core (in-memory) index which is initially always empty. I think that\u0027s why nobody detected this in advance.",

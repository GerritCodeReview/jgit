      "message": "Not so sure about that. Users should use compatible Git implementations/settings now that is possible. I might have agreed prior to symlink support being available.\n\nIf you have symlinks in the file system, don\u0027t bother using JGit with Java6 or missing SeCreateSymlinkPrivilege.\n\nIt\u0027s like trying to work on the Linux kernel on a Mac default file system. It\u0027s not Gits job to fix the issues.",

      "message": "Maybe this has the wrong semantics for a method called \"clear\", since it replaces the existing instance rather than just clearing its contents. I was hoping this didn\u0027t matter, but since we expose the configured instance via #getInstance() below, it\u0027s theoretically possible that a caller might notice.\n\nWe could always implement a clear() method on DfsBlockCache itself, I suppose. Or just rename this method to something that\u0027s not \"clear\"? Or just document the semantics.",

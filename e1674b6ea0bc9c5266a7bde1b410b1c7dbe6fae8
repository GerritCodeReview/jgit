      "message": "Ugh. git-core really accepts repositories with no repositoryformatversion field? I thought this was a required property that was part of the way it was safe to assume this directory really contains a Git repository.\n\nBefore we make this change I would like some documentation in the commit message pointing to where in git-core it says its OK to open a repository without a repositoryformatversion field.",

      "message": "This means garbage objects from such packs will never migrate to an UNREACHABLE_GARBAGE pack, so even after a GC (even in the presence of no ref updates) the \"GC\" packs will contain a mix of live and garbage objects.\n\nI think we could get into a pathological scenario where there are many GC packs, but due to many force pushes most GC packs are mostly garbage.\n\nIt may be that the cost of such a scenario is lower than the cost of doing a full GC on such a large repository. (Particularly since these kinds of repositories are rarely cloned in their entirety, so we would be unlikely to be able to reuse a cached pack even if we had one.)\n\nI\u0027m also a little concerned that we would have no way of knowing if we were in such a situation just by looking at the packs in the repository; you would have to do some reachability check on the packs (e.g. do a full clone).",

      "message": "We are not overriding the method getBaseCommit() inherited from Merger.java. Therefore we are using here the default implementation which will throw an IOException when we find more then one common ancestor. This breaks MergeCommannd.call() which is an important API of JGit. In MergeCommand.call() we are calling getBaseCommit() when we populate the MergeResult after a succesfull merge. Although the recursive merge was succesfull we are getting hit by this IOException and the call finally fails. We have to override getBaseCommit() because we should not throw an IOException when we find more than one common predecessor. I have proposed a different implementation in the next patchset",

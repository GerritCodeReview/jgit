      "message": "Yes, of course. you are right. If we don\u0027t have conflicts because of the content (either because contents are equal or conflict-free mergeable) then we should avoid reporting a conflict for mode changes happening on one side only.\nAnd additionally: If we create new content through a content merge then we have to decide on a filemode for that new file revision. Also here we should do a better solution then just picking the first filemode we find as I do now in getFileMode():\nI\u0027ll propose a fix for that",

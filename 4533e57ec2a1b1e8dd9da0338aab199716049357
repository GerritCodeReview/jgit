      "message": "In the end we want native gits DIR_NO_GITLINK semantic. That would require (as discussed in the predecessor change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/51405/) some logic to be in TreeWalk because we need access to WorkingTreeIterator AND DirCacheIterator.\n\nIn this change you are suggesting a more simple way which only looks at FileTreeIterator. I fear if we change the API like we discussed up to know we would have to change it again when full fledged DIR_NO_GITLINK comes. And we would have to move responsibility for mode detection from FileTreeIterator to TreeWalk. Looks not so good.\n\nI wanted to suggest a callback mechanism and played with it until I saw that it looks very much like your FileModeStrategy in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/51483. If we have that change in first then you could implement your first strategy in this change quite easily. And later on we could implement a different strategy with access to dircache and people could choose based on their use case what fits best.\n\nTherefore I suggest we bring  https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/51483 in first. Sorry for this back and forth.",

In that case, any suggestions on how to get access to the WorkingTreeOptions from here without breaking API?  Maybe I could add a second constructor for FileEntry that accepts this argument, but then I\u0027m not sure what would be the correct behavior here if you used the original constructor signature.",

      "message": "Currently I have not found a real problem with this but wanted to make you aware about the following:\n\nI think we are changing semantics a little bit here. Before one precondition for getRef() to throw an IOException was that the caller specified needle did not contain a \"/\". Even  if we got an IOException from readRef() we sometimes didn\u0027t rethrow that and simply moved to the next searchPath element. That\u0027s not true anymore. Even if the needle contains a \u0027/\u0027 we may throw an IOException.",

      "message": "+1. Right, I overlooked the leading \"!\". My fault.\nThe reason I looked longer on this is that you just removed a complicated if block controlling when we throw exceptions.  I thought: that must be a semantic change. But I am convinced now that\u0027s ok. The check in readAndResolve() whether the full name contains a \"/\" really replaces this beast.",

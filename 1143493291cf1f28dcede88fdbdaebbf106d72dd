      "message": "Should this check occur earlier? Suppose I have commits C and D (C is a parent of D) and M (M is a merge of D and C). With the code here, when visiting M\u0027s parents, we\u0027ll\n\n 1. Add D to pending\n 2. Mark C as SEEN, parse it, and skip it.\n\nThen when visiting D\u0027s parents, we\u0027ll\n\n 1. Encounter C, which is SEEN, so skip it\n\nThus the first-parent history would look like \"M, D\" instead of \"M, D, C\". Intended?\n\n(Noticed at https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/143231/6/org.eclipse.jgit/src/org/eclipse/jgit/revwalk/PendingGenerator.java#146)",

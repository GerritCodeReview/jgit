      "message": "Apart from the comments, I also did some high level verification: \n\n1. I compared the unit tests from https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/t/t5318-commit-graph.sh to the unit tests written by Kyle and I think his unit tests are a good translation of the unit tests from cgit (both quality-wise as well as scope-wise). \n\n2. I verified that both jgit and cgit produce an identical commit-graph file for the same repo. I verified this by creating a local repo with the same graph structure as https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/t/t5318-commit-graph.sh described in lines 186 to 194 and then letting both jgit and cgit write the commit-graph. \n\n3. I executed both CommitGraphWriterTest and CommitGraphTest with code-coverage turned on. I concluded that both CommitGraphWriter and CommitGraph are sufficiently tested. \n\n",

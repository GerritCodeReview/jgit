They can contain more than one ref.  And in FETCH_HEAD\u0027s case, they also have URL data and branch data.  The fact that they can work like a ref is a bug in the C Git implementation that only looks at the first 40 bytes of a \"ref like file\" to see if it is a SHA-1.  In hindsight we might never have permitted these files to be \"ref like\" by having a stricter ref file parser.",

If we\u0027re going to use the same file for all commands, and thus enable translation reuse (which makes a lot of sense), we should at least try to keep the catalog organized so its easier to locate a particular key when we need to.",

E.g. call this remoteNameMetaVar instead of just name.  Translators might need to use a different term for a variable meant to be a remote name from some other context where a \"name\" is used.",

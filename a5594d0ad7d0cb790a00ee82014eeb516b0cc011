      "message": "This is a much smaller test which should ideally succeed. But this test shows some bugs/limitations in JGit. \n1) It is not possible prevent a reflog message to be written; I\u0027ll propose a fix in CommitCommand\n2) When garbage collection is done and the reflogs are inspected then both newid and oldid are taken into account. I am no sure whether this is correct or whether only newid should be taken. I\u0027ll inspect CGit for that and upload a change.",

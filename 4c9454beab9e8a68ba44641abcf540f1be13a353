      "message": "I hate this, but doing this without reflection is very hard.\n\nEssentially we\u0027d need a cache of JSch instances not by host but by user name and host. Then we could provide Jsch a customized session-specific OpenSshConfig in which we\u0027d already have set the user name to the one from the URI.\n\nDoing so would also enable us to properly do the %p and %r replacements in OpenSshConfig. While it should be possible with such an approach to avoid this reflection here, it is a rather major refactoring, and I don\u0027t see how to do it without breaking interfaces. I also don\u0027t have the time to take on such a larger refactoring now; I\u0027m up to my ears in $DAYJOB work.\n\nSo this is the best stop-gap measure I could come up with.",

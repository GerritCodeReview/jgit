      "message": "Maybe I\u0027m missing something obvious as I\u0027m not familiar with this code. But I don\u0027t understand all this code (both Hector\u0027s original version and this changed version).\n\nFirst, isn\u0027t there still a race condition between asynchronous GC removing a directory and some other thread (or even external git) concurrently trying to create a new loose ref? What if the directory deletion here happens _between_ the mkdirs() and the createNewFile() in LockFile.lock()? Then creating the new ref would fail because GC just removed the directory that LockFile thought it had just ensured that it existed. (Since the directory exists already, the mkdirs() would not even have changed the timestamp...)\n\nSecond, if I\u0027m reading the code of RefDirectory.pack() correctly, empty ref directories should be removed there already?",

      "message": "An alternative to this I discussed with Martin was to add a createFile() method to FS, have a default implementation as a passthrough to new File(), and in FS_POSIX have it always create NFSFile. NFSFile could then become an inner class of FS_POSIX (or move somewhere else).\n\nIf folks are interested in that approach, I\u0027d be willing to make the changes.",

Is the idea that callers might want to make a custom ReachabilityChecker and that using the Repository as a ReachabilityChecker factory makes that more straightforward?\n\nIn other words, my question is, what does a typical caller look like? Perhaps it\u0027s straightforward for the proposed better ReachabilityChecker to be part of JGit and avoid some complication.",

      "message": "why is day the smallest unit when specifying the expire parameter?\n\nThe --expire option in the native Git understands also options like:\n\n --expire\u003d1.minute\n --expire\u003d10.seconds\n --expire\u003d2.hours\n ...\n\nThis makes hard writing automated tests where I would like to create two non-reachable objects:\n\n object creation-time\n A      T1\n B      T2\n\nand specify the --expire to be between the T1 and T2 and check  that A is pruned and B is not pruned.\n\nIf you don\u0027t want to deal with the time-unit strings (like \"1.minute\", ...) then I would propose to use:\n\n long expire\n\nor:\n\n java.util.Date expire\n\nwhere is the number of milliseconds since Jan 1st 1970 UTC.\n\nAll objects older, non-reachable objects older than \u0027expire\u0027 timestamp are candidates for pruning.",

I don\u0027t like Date because this refers to a certain point in time - but native git only accepts timespans which have to be elapsed before we consider files for pruning",

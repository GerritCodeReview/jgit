      "message": "This statements confuses me a little bit. Do I get it right: with this patch set we are NOT adding code which would add \u0027000..\u0027 values to the index? Only if in the future all parties would accept \u0027000...\u0027 content as a marker for conflicts then we may concider writing such entries? Right?\n\nThat would be fine with me.\n\nI wanted to check native git behaviour, but I am not so sure how this \u0027ignoreConflicts\u0027 functionality is exposed. We use it mainly to have a common parent content to be displayed e.g. in gerrit ui when presenting conflicts, right? I tried with https://gist.github.com/chalstrick/ee18d33988d4751fbd640b2c035f61f9",

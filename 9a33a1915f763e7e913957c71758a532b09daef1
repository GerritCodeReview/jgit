See https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jgit/jgit/+/167370 .\n\n  long timeout \u003d getTimeout();\n  if (timeout \u003c\u003d 0) {\n    timeout \u003d 10; // Or some other reasonably small value\n  }\n  process.waitFor(timeout, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\n\nwould at least not wait indefinitely if a server is mis-behaved. Or perhaps just always use a timeout of a few seconds.",

The timeout applies to whole fetch and push operation which is likely not to finish in this small amount of time.\n\nI don\u0027t understand why you want to protect users. If they do not set the timeout then anything can happen. They will have to fix their usage.",

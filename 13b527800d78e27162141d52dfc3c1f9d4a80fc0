      "message": "hmmm. For the current path we only see files in HEAD,MERGE,INDEX. Means for these three states we definitly don\u0027t have a file/directory conflict and also not for the pathes of the parents (any prefixes of the current path). If we see files here then all our parent pathes must be directories. So they also don\u0027t face a file/directory conflict.\n\nBut: there could be a folder in the working tree for the current path or for any parent path. walk.isDirectoryFileConflict() is checking for the workingtree while our ffMask is ignoring the working tree.\n\nTo understand better what we gain with this change we need a test.",

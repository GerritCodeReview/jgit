      "message": "This line just looks wrong to me. We can\u0027t assume that all the reused bitmaps from a previous pack are all in a single linear history, so ORing in \"reuse\" here seems incorrect.\n\nI think the way to move forward is to simplify and clarify semantics (like you are doing by replacing BitmapBuilder.add()) and add tests that verify those semantics. Then maybe things won\u0027t be so murky. I\u0027ll think about a test for this.",

I can do a little history mining tomorrow.\n\nBut (luckily?) if I am reading correctly it would be safe to remove this line. Consider where this bitmap is used after this line:\n\n1. It gets recorded in tipCommitBitmaps\n2. In the while((rc \u003d rw.next()) !\u003d null) walk, we check if it contains each commit \u0027rc\u0027. Luckily the commits in \u0027reuse\u0027 cannot appear as \u0027rc\u0027, since each commit in reuseCommits has already been marked uninteresting.\n3. We then AND the bitmap against the complement of reuse.\n\nSo the OR-ing against reuse would have had no effect, since it was soon undone.",

      "message": "\u003e It isn\u0027t straightforward to understand why you do need again to call openFail() in this line of code: what about adding a comment with the rationale?\n\nI personally think a comment here explaining that would be inappropriate. The openFail() method is called from every failure path in here to do \"housekeeping\". I was also confused as to what housekeeping needed to be done in here, however when I looked at the openFail() method it explained things for me. If a comment were put here to explain what openFail() does, it runs the risk of quickly becoming out of date with what the method actually does and thus would be a maintenance issue. Do you have any suggestions for making the code flow clearer instead of adding a comment here?",

      "message": "Isn\u0027t this quite ineffective? We are implementing a method which explicitly expects a fully qualified ref name and which therefore does not have to deal with iterating SEARCH_PATH. But the implementation is done by calling the expensive method which does all this iterating over the SEARCH_PATH and to throw away the results if we see the input ref name was not the a qualified one. Maybe an internal getRef() method should learn to use a explicitly given SEARCH_PATH.",

      "message": "I mean stable-4.1 --- sorry for the confusion.\n\nI could go either way, myself:\n\nOn one hand exactRef is relatively new so there aren\u0027t too many callers and most callers would have been using getRef before (so this implementation of exactRef adds some correctness and at least doesn\u0027t hurt performance). That makes it tempting to get this fix in in the stable branches and let the faster implementation cook for 4.3.\n\nOn the other hand this fix would introduce a small performance regression which we could avoid by also applying 60108.",

      "message": "Isn\u0027t this quite ineffective? We are implementing a method which explicitly expects a fully qualified ref name and which therefore does not have to deal with iterating SEARCH_PATH. But the implementation is done by calling the expensive method which does all this iterating over the SEARCH_PATH and to throw away the results if we see the input ref name was not the a qualified one. Maybe an internal getRef() method should learn to use a explicitly given SEARCH_PATH.",

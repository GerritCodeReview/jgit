      "message": "255 is allowed\nreverting the order of operands this way is unnatural makes it easy to read it the wrong way. When there is only one condition or the condition expresses a between condition it is easier to read correctly,  min \u003c v \u003c max style. Howevery I prefer the variable op constant pattern always, because that aligns with how we pronounce the expression.\n\nHence this one is easier to grasp\n\nif  (chan \u003c\u003d0 || chan \u003e 255) throw...\n\nAnd the valid range is [1..255], I think, according to the condition\n\nif (!( 0 \u003c chan \u0026\u0026 chan \u003c\u003d 255)) would be readable too, but perhaps top many parenthese for some people.",

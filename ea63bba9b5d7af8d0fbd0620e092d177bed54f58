Its issue 251 [1].\n\nRegarding the // at the end of the line, I rely very heavily on the Eclipse source code formatter style we have defined for the project.  When it doesn\u0027t break the lines nicely, I sometimes force the line breaking manually by renaming symbols until it breaks the way I want (and the name still makes sense), or I insert comments like this.\n\nIn this case the default breaking was unreadable compared to what I have forced manually.\n\n[1] http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/issues/detail?id\u003d251",

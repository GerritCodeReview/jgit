      "message": "Most of the callers of this method, that didn\u0027t need the Map and just iterated it to get a List of refs, have already been refactored to use the new methods that return List\u003cString\u003e.\n\nHowever there are still 6 callers of this method [1] that expect to get a Map, and that Map gets passed down deeper into the implementation. Reworking those doesn\u0027t seem trivial.  Did you have a plan to tackle them later?\n\n[1] http://paste.openstack.org/show/721056/",

      "message": "I so often had to fight with racy git problems where two threads managed to update the same file within the same tick of the filesystem clock that I vote against a simple lastmodified check. You mentioned using FileSnapshot which helps a little bit. In this case where we look at Packfiles it is very unlikely that you produce a Packfile with same name (means: same objects included), with different checksum (e.g. compression rate was modified) but with the same file length. So checking that the length has changed could be added as a check.",

We should be focusing on the trash directory, as its not in tmpdir and gets cleaned up by the unit test framework we inherit from in our base class.\n\nThis should be a unique name that doesn\u0027t exist:\n\n  File notHere \u003d new File(trash, \"not-a-git.git\");\n\ntrash is a java.io.File inherited down which tells us the temporary directory everything is within. Within that, we create a repository called \"test????_???\". Otherwise the trash directory is empty. So we should never see \"not-a-git.git\" be present within it.",

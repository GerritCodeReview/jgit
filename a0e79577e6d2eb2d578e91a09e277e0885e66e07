      "message": "This is entirely unnecessary. You create an empty index on line 558. There is nothing to read from .gitmodules. There is nothing to delete from the index.\n\nYou then proceed to write all new content out to the index, and commit that. You \"update\" by just \"replacing it all\". Which is actually pretty damn simple.\n\nSo I\u0027m confused about why you need this change.",

      "message": "Although these delete operations are upon an empty index, they\u0027ll be executed upon real tree when writeTree() is called. Or that\u0027s what I understand it.\n\nThis will be useful when there were something in the old manifest but no longer in the new manifest, like removed copyfile, or removed/renamed project (gitlink). I have a unit test to make sure that the removal of copyfile works.",

      "message": "IMHO this is a mess for an application to parse.\n\nFor this high-level of our API we should have this be a lot easier to work with.  Its a ton more code, but application developers would appreciate something cleaner than a Map of int arrays of int arrays. Just saying it is painful.\n\nWe should do a FileConflictInfo object that is the value of this map, so we have Map\u003cString /* path */, FileConflictInfo\u003e.\n\nThe FileConflictInfo can then have a List\u003cConflictHunk\u003e to describe all of the hunks that are conflicting.\n\nEach ConflictHunk can then provide more detail about the range that is conflicting for each parent that was put in.",

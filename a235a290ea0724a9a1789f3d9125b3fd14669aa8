      "message": "In the 11 years I am maintaining this library you are the first one who raises this as an issue\n\nThe repository is a content addressable object database which stores:\n- objects addressable by the hash of their content in objects/ implemented in class ObjectDatabase and its hierarchy of subclasses\n- pointers referring to objects or other refs (aka symbolic refs) stored in refs/ implemented in RefDatabase and its subclasses\n- logs of ref changes stored in logs/ (reflogs)\n\nIn JGit db is used as a synonym for repository.\nI think that\u0027s no justification for such a mass renaming\n\nIf this change would be submitted it would cause tons of pointless merge conflicts e.g. when we cherry-pick fixes between branches, rebase stale changes which are in review since a while etc.",
